# General guidelines

We have different shades for every defined color in Orbit. For most of our colors note, the following points should apply:

- Every color has *specific guidelines* for meaning. We honor these guidelines in order to maintain consistency across the product.

- It’s usually *safe to combine* the Light and Dark shades of any color. Text in the Dark shade should be readable on the Light background of its color.

- No Dark shade should be used as a background.

- Every non-Dark color has *two additional shades* defined: :active and :hover. These additional shades should only be used for very specific cases.

- All of our colors are also defined as *design tokens*, so non-Orbit components can use Orbit colors directly and they don’t need to define colors again in their local codebase.
