# Documentation ðŸš€

Design system for all forward thinkers, creators and true product makers

---

Our vision is to provide the tools needed for building incredible maker products.

From our perspective,Â *we aim to bring order and consistencyÂ *to products and the processes behind them. We elevate the user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products

As a company, we believe that by giving people resources to create products easily, we all will make humanity better. Together.

## Principles behind Documentation

These are the values we use to build and maintain Rocket.

To be honest, Rocket isnâ€™t currently fully compliant with some of our principles, but weâ€™re working on it every day. These principles help us keep on track and*Â stay focused on the right things*.

Focus is truly the most important thing.

## Find the best middle ground

There are 4 key aspects when working on Rocket. Our goal is to meet somewhere in the middleâ€”so everything we do isnâ€™t just consistent or composable, but improves the work of our designers and developers and is maintainable in the long-term.

### Be transparent

Transparency is the key to success. Thatâ€™s why we have aÂ *public roadmap and open feedback channels*. But weâ€™re trying to go further. We document our design decisions so we can reference them in discussions and not reinvent the wheel again by discussing stuff repeatedly and without historical context.

### Listen and react

The first and most important part: nothing in Rocket was done without research. Listen to users, actively ask for feedback, and act on usersâ€™ needs. When answering, provide enough context. Donâ€™t let people wait for our answers. Their job may be blocked by Rocket and they may rely on us to help them.

### Make things intuitive

Not many people read the documentation. Our goal is to make everything as simple as possible, ideally self-explanatory. We believe that consistency is followed closely by clarity. We encourage experimentation. We welcome new solutions. But our focus is on using patterns and vocabulary that are familiar to our users.

### Give consumers just enough control

The priority for Rocket consumers is to always deliver the feature they need to work on. And they expect Rocket to be a tool that just works. Give consumers delightful components and provide enough flexibility in how to assemble them for the specific use case they have. Ensure consistency in visual interactions, but allow consumers to extend components by their own actions.

## Let's begin

Now that you know all the basic principles, the journey through our design system can truly begin.
